# Spelling Bee Solver

A Python tool and GUI to help solve the New York Times **Spelling Bee** game.

## Features
- Input 7 letters and specify the mandatory center letter.
- Displays all valid words from a comprehensive English wordlist.
- Highlights **pangrams** separately.
- Scrollable GUI built with `tkinter`.
- Uses the [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) dataset.
